## Production Readiness

- [x] Local SQLite database working
- [x] Railway PostgreSQL configured
- [x] Schema supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Migration scripts ready
- [ ] Ready for Railway deployment

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Switch to PostgreSQL in production
4. Run migrations on Railway: `railway run npx prisma migrate deploy`

---
**Conclusion**: Database connection is fully functional. All CRUD operations, relations, and tools (Prisma Studio) are working as expected. Ready for production deployment.
